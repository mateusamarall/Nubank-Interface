# Conclusion

First, I need to thanks RocketSeat for provide this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDm0M_rZLJo">video</a> for free on youtube so thank you!!. With this project  I realized the react-native power and the things learned here I'll apply in my futures apps mainly the qrcode's animation.
